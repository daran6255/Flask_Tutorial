# ðŸ§  Understanding REST in Simple English

## What is REST?

**REST** stands for **Representational State Transfer**.

- Itâ€™s a way to build **APIs** (apps that talk to other apps).
- REST uses **HTTP methods** like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- Each method is used to do a specific job.

## ðŸ“¬ What Are Routes and HTTP Methods?

In Flask:

- A **route** is like an address (URL) for a page or action.
- An **HTTP method** tells what kind of action you want to do:
  
| Method 	| What It Does                	| Example Use            |
|-----------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| GET    	| Get (read) some data         	| Show all items        `|
| POST   	| Send (create) new data       	| Add a new item        `|
| PUT   	| Replace/update all data       | Replace an entire item |
| PATCH   	| Update part of existing data  | Change item's name only|
| DELETE   	| Remove existing data       	| Delete an item        `|
